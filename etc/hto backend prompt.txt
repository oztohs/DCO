 @backend users going to select machine and click button to start machines they will hack,
the server is going to start selected machine by creating aws ec2 instance with AMI.
machine images for each selected machine are ready on AMI.
each machine images have every different environments that can be hacked
once the instance starts, instance post its VPN IP with user id and instance id to server by shell script.
and the server get and store the address at DB temporally and show the machine's address to user.
when the machine start, the instance should be created by matching images with user's selection.
each users need to have their own instance, An instance cannot be shared by multiple users
when users submit the flag which is hidden on the machine, the machine stops and delete the ec2 instance and delete instance info on DB
make it happen and give me everything necessaries.
